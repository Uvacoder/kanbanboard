### Backendless using LocalStorage to save state (alternate API actions included)
A quick solution to a given narrow hypothetical project definition to demonstrate ability.
No component libraries were used. Tailwind was used for styling and layout.

Tavle (tav-l√§) is the Nowegian word for 'whiteboard'.
